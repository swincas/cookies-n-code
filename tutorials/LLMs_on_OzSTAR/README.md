# Running LLMs on OzSTAR

Author: Colin Jacobs

## The guide
Large Language Models (LLM's) are becoming commonplace in our day to day lives - whether we like it or not. Why not take advantage of them to help your workflow?
Colin talks through the great resources we have available to us at CAS, and how we can make the most of them to run LLM's for research uses.
