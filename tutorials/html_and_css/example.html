  <h1>Introduction to HTML and CSS</h1>
  <h2>The Basics: Tags, Elements, and Attributes</h2>

  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is a markup language similar to LaTeX, Markdown, or RST. Initially developed in 1991, it's seen multiple versions over the years, with the latest major version being HTML 5 in 2014 (though it's up to 5.2 now). HTML 5 brought a lot of major improvements and removed some cruft from earlier versions, so it's kinda like the Python 3 of HTML except not as backwards-incompatible.</p>

  <h3>Tags</h3>

  <p>Everything in HTML lives inside <span class="italics">tags</span>. Tags are always enclosed in angle braces, like this: <span class="block">&lt;...&gt;</span>. This document itself lives entirely inside  the <span class="tag">html</span> tag. Most tags need to be closed, which is done by adding a &#47; just after the opening brace. Here's an example of a properly-formatted tag:</p>

  <blockquote class="block">&lt;html&gt;...&lt;&#47;html&gt;</blockquote>

  <p>For <span class="small-caps">reasons</span>, the <span class="tag">html</span> tag at the very beginning of your document needs to include the text "!DOCTYPE" at the start, like so: <span class="block">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>.)</p>

  <p>Within the <span class="tag">html</span> tag live two other important tags: the  <span class="tag">head</span> and <span class="tag">body</span> tags. The <span class="tag">head</span> tag contains meta information about your webpage: things like the language it's in, or links to CSS stylesheets (we'll get to those!) or JavaScript files. The <span class="tag">body</span> tag contains the actual content of your webpage which will be visible to users.</p>

  <p>(HTML is an incredibly forgiving language, in that browsers have all sorts of spaghetti code to deal with legacy features and improper formatting. For instance, it's often possible to get away without closing certain tags; browsers will make a best guess which is often correct. For the sake of everyone who will ever read your code [including you], please do not abuse this.)</p>

  <h4>Document Structure</h4>

  <p>Within the <span class="tag">body</span> tag, you can have headers given within tags running from <span class="block">&lt;<span class="tag">h1</span>&gt;</span> to <span class="block">&lt;<span class="tag">h6</span>&gt;</span>, which give different sizes of headers. The <span class="tag">p</span> tag allows you to group text into <span class="bold block">p</span>aragraphs.</p>

  <p>Two very useful tags to know about are the <span class="tag">div</span> and <span class="tag">span</span> tags. You can use these as convenient containers to hold whatever content you want. <span class="tag">div</span> is useful as a larger container holding multiple elements within it, while <span class="tag">span</span> is used more for inline test, like when you want to apply a particular <span id="example-style">style</span> to a few words.</p>

  <p>Another highly important tag is the <span class="tag">a</span> tag. This is what allows you to <span class="italics">hyperlink</span> to other webpages. (No, I don't know why <span class="tag">a</span> stands for "hyperlink".) To actually make a working hyperlink, we need to know about:</p>

  <h3>Attributes</h3>

  <p>Everything contained within a matching pair of tags is known as an <span class="italics">element</span>. Elements can have <span class="italics">attributes</span>, which are specified within the open tag. For example, to make a working hyperlink, you use the <span class="attribute">href</span> attribute within an <span class="tag">a</span> tag, like so:</p>

  <blockquote>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;A link you can click to go to Google.com&lt&#47;a&gt</blockquote>

  <p>And here's what that would look like in action: <a href="http://www.google.com">A link you can click to go to Google.com</a>.</p>

  <p>There are a number of attributes in HTML, and different elements can have different attributes attached to them. To display an image, for instance, you'd use the <span class="attribute">src</span> attribute within the <span class="tag">image</span> tag, like so:</p>

  <blockquote>&lt;img src="some_image.png"&gt;</blockquote>

<p>(Some tags, like <span class="tag">img</span>, don't require a matching end tag. Exceptions to rules make everyones' lives exciting! &lt;/sarcasm&gt; [&larr;not actually a real tag])</p>

  <h4>Some Important Attributes</h4>

  <p>Two very useful attributes that can be used in any element are the <span class="attribute">id</span> and <span class="attribute">class</span> attributes. <span class="attribute">id</span> allows you specify a unique ID to any particular element, while <span class="attribute">class</span> allows you to designate multiple elements as members of the same class. IDs and classes are completely up to you to decide, and allow you to easily specify styling to specific elements or sets of elements using CSS.</p>

  <p>There's a lot more to talk about with HTML, but even with just this small collection of tags and attributes you can accomplish a lot. You can learn a lot more about it at the official <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> schools page: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>.</p>

  <h2>CSS</h2>

  <p>CSS, which stands for <span class="italics">Cascading Style Sheets</span>, was introduced in the 1990s to solve a problem: HTML is intended to specify the <span class="italics">layout</span> and <span class="italics">structure</span> of a webpage, not the <span class="italics">style</span>. While browsers do have generic styles sheets which they apply to webpages (such as making an <span class="tag">h1</span> element bigger than an <span class="tag">h6</span> element), in general browsers apply minimal formatting to HTML, instead relying on an accompanying style sheet to dictate how a webpage should appear.</p>

  <h3>Rule-sets</h2>

  <p>CSS works by using a system of <span class="italics">rule-sets</span>, which select elements in the page using a variety of specification methods (called selectors). The rule-set then applies a particular style change to the element(s). The "cascading" part come from how these style changes propagate and override each other (which has a defined order, but is more advanced than needed here). This is also where the <span class="tag">div</span> and <span class="tag">span</span> tags and <span class="attribute">id</span> and <span class="attribute">class</span> attributes come into play.</p>

  <p>A simple example: let's say I'd like to make particular words in my webpage be <span class="red-text">red</span>. The way I've done it here is by using a <span class="tag">span</span> tag with a custom <span class="attribute">class</span> attribute of "red-text", like this: <span class="block">&lt;span class="red-text"&gt;red&lt;&#47;span&gt;</span>. Next, I'll create a rule in my CSS file (we'll get to how to link the two in a second):</p>

  <blockquote class="block">.red-text {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br>
}</blockquote>

  <p>The period is used to indicate that this rule should apply to the class which is immediately following the period, in this case "red-text". If you instead want to apply a rule to all tags of a particular kind, you just put the tag name (without a period). If you want to make a rule to apply to a particular ID, you preface it with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#Other_names_in_English">octothorp</a> (&#35;) instead.</p>

  <h3>Applying CSS to a Webpage</h3>

 <p>Now, it's <span class="italics">possible</span> to apply CSS to a single element using the <span class="attribute">style</span> attribute in that element, like this: <span class="block">&ltp style="color:red;"&gt;...&lt&#47;p&gt;</span>. This would give you a paragraph in which everything is red. It's not recommended, however, because the whole point of CSS is to separate structure from style, so putting it in your HTML document muddies the water and makes it harder to update.</p>

  <p>Instead, the recommended way to use CSS is to put it in its own .css file which can be linked to from individual webpages. (Useful if you have a large website with many pages, all of which can link to one CSS file to get a consistent visual style.) To link a style sheet, use the <span class="tag">link</span> tag within the <span class="tag">head</span> of your document, with a couple of new attributes we haven't seen before (<span class="attribute">rel</span> and <span class="attribute">type</span>), and the <span class="attribute">href</span> to provide the link to the file. Here's the element used in this document to link the spreadsheet in the same folder:</p>

  <blockquote class="block">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="example_stylesheet.css"&gt;
</blockquote>

  <p>(<span class="tag">link</span> is another of those tags that don't need to be closed.)</p>

  <p>By convention, the root webpage for a site is called <span class="block">index.html</span>, and the directory it's in will be considered the root directory when specifying the path to the CSS file. So if your CSS file <span class="block">myStyle.css</span> lives in the <span class="block">css</span> directory inside the <span class="block">assets</span> directory in the directory where your <span class="block">index.html</span> is, the <span class="attribute">href</span> attribute to link to it would be <span class="block">href="assets/css/myStyle.css"</span>.</p>

  <p>CSS is <span class="italics">incredibly</span> powerful and versatile at this point, and this barely begins to scratch the surface. Like for HTML, I can recommend the official W3C webpage on CSS as a resource to find out what kinds of things you can do with it: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp</a>. CSS used to be limited to static styles, but you can now use it to do things like make simple animations and change the style of an element when people mouseover it. And if you want to get even more complicated, you can add JavaScript into your webpage to do even more things (but that's a whole 'nother tutorial on its own).</p>

  <p>Now get out there and have some fun in the wonderful wide world of web design!</p>
