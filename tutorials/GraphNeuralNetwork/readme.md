# Graph Neural Networks

Author: Shreejit Jadhav

## The guide
Shreejit breaks down the mysterious world of graph neural networks. This presentation is based on the fantastic articles on Distill.pub: 
- [Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/)
- [Understanding Convolutions on Graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/)
Download the [Jupyter Notebook](GNN_tutorial.ipynb) created by Shreejit and follow along!
