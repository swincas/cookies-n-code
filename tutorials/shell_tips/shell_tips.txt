Shell Tips and Tricks

Adam, @abatten: `cd -`
Using `cd -` will take you back to the last directory you were in.
This is good for changing between two directories.


Renee, @respiewak: `grep -A NUM`
If you're interested in a few lines of a file _following_ a particular
keyword, using `grep -A NUM` is your best bet. The opposite is
`grep -B NUM`, to show lines before the matching line. 

`head` and `tail`
`head` without any flags will give you the first 10 lines of the input (file), and `tail` will 
give you the last 10. Add a number as a flag (e.g., `head -20`) and you now get that number of 
lines (first or last). Use `-n N` for a similar effect (showing N lines). OR show **all but** 
the first N lines with `tail -n +N` (all but the last N lines with `head -n -N`). 


Daniel, @DBerke: `find`
`find` is a really powerful command that can replicate or replace the 
functionality of several other commands such as ls, grep, or rm. The problem
is that it's SO powerful that it's not easy to use at first due to all the
options. Just a few really helpful ones:

-type [d,f]
    Follow this with a `d` for directory or `f` for file. Allows you to filter
    out what you want find to search for.
-maxdepth, -mindepth n
    This tells find how many directories deep to search. You can easily limit
    it to looking only in the current directory, or to search everything below
    the current directory, or only in directories exactly two deep.
-delete
    Powerful. *Extremely* dangerous. But also useful. Ever tried to delete a few
    thousand files with rm and have it fail because the argument list is too
    long? `find . * -delete` will delete everything in the current folder, no
    matter how many there are.
-exec utility {} [;|+]
    A rather interesting alternative to using a pipe, this will execute a
    given program on each object returned by find. Must be terminated by
    either a semicolon (which operates on each path-name individually) or a plus
    sign (with gives the program as many path-names as it can handle at each
    invocation). The '{}' is used to stand in for the path-name(s). ';' may
    need to be escaped in the shell as '\;'.
    Oh yeah, you can use this to chain successive find commands together, too.

Taken together, find can do some extremely powerful things in a single
command.

A practical example: I have 17,591 FITS files spread out over 197 directories
corresponding to individual stars. I know some (a small fraction) of these
files, contrary to what I want, have a signal-to-noise ratio of < 200, as
noted in a FITS header called 'SNR'. Running this command from the parent
directory containing all the subdirectories allows me to find all such files:

find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -name ADP*.fits | xargs -n 1 dfits  | fitsort SNR
 | grep -v SNR | awk ' $2 < 200 { print }'

`find` searches for all ADP*.fits files one level down below the current
directory, then passes those file names one at a time (using xargs) to dfits,
which spits out all the FITS header information to fitsort, which displays
the filename and the value of any headers given (in this case, 'SNR'). (It
also diplays a row at the start consisting of 'FILENAME     SNR', which the 
`grep -v` removes.) `awk` then takes the second column of the resulting
output (containing the numerical value of the SNR) and evaluates it, printing
the line (which contains the filename) if the SNR is less than 200.

The output looks something like this:
HD126525/ADP.2014-09-16T11:03:33.730.fits	156.75           	
HD126525/ADP.2014-09-16T11:03:45.367.fits	185.1            	
HD126525/ADP.2014-09-16T11:04:13.733.fits	181.45 
...


Also a resource I use a lot, The UNIX Grymoire:

Helpful, understandable tutorials on things like regular expressions, find,
sed, the bash shell, etc.


Marisa @mgeyer: recap extensions, basenames etc in tcsh
Been using this a lot this week:

set file = /usr/joe/backup.tar.gz

echo $file:h   #head
echo $file:t   #tail
echo $file:r   #root
echo $file:e   #extension
echo $file:t:r:r  #combos
echo $file:h:h
will produce this:

/usr/joe
backup.tar.gz
/usr/joe/backup.tar
gz
backup
/usr



Danny Price:
Edit your ~/.input_rc and add:

"\e[A":history-search-backward
"\e[B":history-search-forward
Then restart your terminal. This lets you search through your
bash history using the up and down keys – type that start of
the command (e.g. ‘ech’) and then press up to complete (e.g.
‘echo HELLO’).

Use a variable if you’re calling the same thing

> fn=my_filename.txt
> head $fn
This works really well if you use the input_rc thing, or if you
have a more complex command (e.g. run.py -a $fn -b $fn -c $fn2).

One-liner for loops with ls follow from this:

for fn in `ls | grep txt`; do head $fn; done
this loops through all files (ls) that have txt in the name
(piped to grep txt), then runs head on them.
