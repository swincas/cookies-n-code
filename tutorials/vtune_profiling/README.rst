This is a set of basic instructions I (Jacob) used to profile my code on g2.

**Requirements:** Have the ability to display a GUI from g2 onto your screen.  For Mac I used *Xquartz* and for Windows I believe it's called *Xming*. 
	   
0. Launch *Xquartz*/*Xming*.  **Note**: For the GUI to be displayed I had to launch a terminal directly from *Xquartz*; right click Xquartz > Applications > Terminal.  From what I've read this isn't common behaviour but I'd recommend doing this. 

1. ``ssh`` onto g2 using Xforwarding which forwards the Vtune GUI onto your local screen. For terminal you simply need to add the ``-Y`` option to your ``ssh`` call,  e.g. ``ssh -Y jseiler@g2.hpc.swin.edu.au``. If you're using *Putty* on Windows there will be an option under SSH > X11 that says *Enable X11 Forwarding* which you need to check.

2. Be a considerate user and move onto an interactive node; ``ssh -Y sstar001``.

3a. Load the Intel module; ``module load intel/13.3.1``.

3b. Remember to load any modules that your code needs to run on g2.

4. Set the environment variables for Vtune; ``source /home/msinha/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe_2013/amplxe-vars.sh``
	
5. Launch Vtune; ``amplxe-gui``.  This should launch an interactive screen for Vtune. 

6. Set up a new project.  You will need to specify the location of your code you want to profile (*Application*) and any input parameters that it takes (*Application parameters*). It also may be a good idea to change the *Automatically stop collection after (sec)* parameter to a few minutes; if your full program iterates a number of times but does the same calculations each iteration then it may not be necessary to run your code for the entire time.  Simply run it for a few minutes and you should get a good idea of the bottlenecks.
	
7. Start a New Analysis by clicking *New Analysis*.  Specify *CPU Sample Time* as 1ms and hit Start.
 
8. Wait patiently.

9. The summary of your code should be automatically generated. Clicking on *Bottom-Up Tree* will show you a list of functions and their corresponding CPU time.  From this you can identifiy the parts of your code that is causing the largest delay.

10. Celebrate!
