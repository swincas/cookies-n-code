# Introduction to SED Fitting with Bagpipes

Author: Lena Pless

## The guide
Lena gives us an introduction to the Bagpipes python library. Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference of Parameter EStimation (or Bagpipes, which is much less wordy!) is a python library for modelling galaxy spectra and fitting spectroscopic and photometric observations. You can find the pdf of the presentation and the Jupyter Notebook that Lena covers at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/LenaPless/Introduction_bagpipes).

## What's covered?
### What is bagpipes?
- What is it used for?

### What kinds of data that bagpipes works with?
- A prepped photometry catalog can be found at [Lena's GitHub link!](https://github.com/LenaPless/Introduction_bagpipes)

### How does the code actually work?
- Fitting single objects with bagpipes
- What does the output look like?
