# Modularising and Packaging Code

This was a tutorial for how any why you should structure your Python code
using modules. 

There are some example scripts in `modularising_code` that share the same functions.
These functions can be extracted and made into a single `utils` (utility) module that
can be imported. This means that you can reuse the same function without having to copy and paste.

There are numerious benafits to this including:
- You can stop copy pasting your own code.
- If you find a bug in one of your functions, you only have to fix it once. Rather than in every script.
