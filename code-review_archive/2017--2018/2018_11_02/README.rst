Demystifying C pointers and function calls
*******************************************

A basic introduction to the pointers in C. Pointers are simply variables
that contain memory addresses (i.e., locations in memory) rather than
the usual variables with typically numeric (integer, float) or strings
(characters). Pointers are immensely powerful way to access, and modify large
datasets without having to create multiple copies. Plus, pointers are also the
preferred way of getting multiple return values from a function.
